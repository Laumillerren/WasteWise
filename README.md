# WasteWise
WasteWise is an image dataset and machine learning model designed to classify waste into three categories: recyclable, non-recyclable, and compostable.

## Definitions of Categories: 

### Recyclable Material:
Definition: Recyclable materials are items that can be collected, processed, and remanufactured into new products. These materials are typically diverted from landfills to be reused.
Examples: Paper, cardboard, glass bottles, aluminum cans, certain plastics (like PETE #1 and HDPE #2).

### Non-Recyclable Material:
Definition: Non-recyclable materials are items that cannot be processed effectively in standard recycling systems, often due to contamination, material composition, or the lack of appropriate recycling infrastructure.
Examples: Styrofoam, plastic bags (unless collected separately), greasy pizza boxes, certain mixed-material packaging, ceramics.

### Compostable Material:
Definition: Compostable materials are organic matter that can break down into nutrient-rich soil through the natural composting process, facilitated by microorganisms, heat, and moisture.
Examples: Fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, yard waste, compostable paper products, certified compostable packaging.
